# Part 2: Communicating with server, countriesinfo

This application allows you to search various countries. The country to be shown is found by typing a search query into the search field.

- If there are too many (over 10) countries that match the query, then the user is prompted to make their query more specific.

- If there are ten or fewer countries, but more than one, then all countries matching the query are shown.

- If there is only one country matching the query, then the basic data of the country are shown:
